So we ant to help them see to the evolution of Canada as we are taking from the example of Tronto database and we will compare to Paris.\n\nToronto and Paris are quite popular tourist and vacation destinations for people all around the world. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is widely sought after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of Toronto and Paris respectively and draw insights to what they look like now."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2-Business Problem:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The aim is to help North african and other tourists to choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have.

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighbourhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighbourhood. For each neighbourhood, we have chosen the radius to be 500 meters.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighbourhood : Name of the Neighbourhood\n2. Neighbourhood Latitude : Latitude of the Neighbourhood\n3. Neighbourhood Longitude : Longitude of the Neighbourhood\n4. Venue : Name of the Venue\n5. Venue Latitude : Latitude of Venue\n6. Venue Longitude : Longitude of Venue\n7. Venue Category : Category of Venue\n\nBased on all the information collected for both Tornto and Paris, we have sufficient data to build our model.
